This one gave me nothing but problems. I tried so many different ways of solving the issues I was having with main1.py and main4.py and yet nothing would work in the way that I was attempting to. I got main2 and main3 to work after a little while, almost exactly as described in the assignment listing. On the whole, the issues I had were mostly in the avenue of attempting to go too big on too little experience. The biggest one being that I never quite figured out how to implement a random list on the first .py, and that was where everything seemed to go wrong. I wanted to still send this in for grading to get feedback, even if my issues with the programs were still present. This way I could get feedback in a succinct way without disrupting the flow of class. All in all, this assignment was a bit of a struggle - as I only managed to commit changes today after working on it for multiple days. Things started to come together, but I'm not sure how much more they will.
